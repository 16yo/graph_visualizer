# This is my graph visualizer written on python.

This program is course project assignment task of the course project of the course of discrete mathematics.

It's functions are builing arbitrary graphs, visualizing it and algorithms for finding euler's and gamilton's chains and cycles.

Algorithms for finding eulers chains and cycles work for any pseudograph. Algorithms for finding gamilton's chains and cycles works only for graphs that satisfy Dirac's condition Theorem.
